__NOTE:__ _We will end up moving this repository to another account and renaming
it. Fair warning provided._

Stork provides a layer of document management over the CouchDB.

## Why another?

Because we wanted something like
[resourceful](https://github.com/flatiron/resourceful) but with multitenant
support and a more native use of CouchDB to support parent/child relationships.
